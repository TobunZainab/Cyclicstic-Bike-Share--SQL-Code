DATA PREPARATION AND PROCESSING

For this analysis, i used the data from 2021-05 to 2022-04. The data was downloaded from the provided link as zip files after which they were converted into CSV. Considering the volume of the data, i decided to analyze using MySQL Workbench and Tableau was used for visualization.
The CSV files were imported into MySQL Workbench. A new schema was created and then the 12 months data was imported into seperate tables using "Table Data Import Wizard". 

The repository shows every step taken to clean and analyse the data in MySQL Workbench.
